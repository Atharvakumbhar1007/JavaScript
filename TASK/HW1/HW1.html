        1. WAP to accept 2 numbers from user and check if their last digit is same or not
        n1 = 563, n2 = 16893
        last_digit = 3 -> in both so last digit of 563 and 16893 is same
        
        2. WAP to calculate electricity bill:
        Accept unit consumed:
        a. if unit consumed is less than or equal to 100 -> then charge amount 5/unit
        b. if unit consumed is between 101 to 200 -> then charge amount 8/unit
        c. if unit consumed is more than 200 -> then charge amount 15/unit
        After bill_amount add fixed amount of 150Rs
        Display Final Amount and Unit Consumed
